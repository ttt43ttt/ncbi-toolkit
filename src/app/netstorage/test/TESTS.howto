This is how-to to run tests.

1. Source code / binary

The tests are developed for the NetStorage API, not specifically for the server.
They however could be used to test the server. The source code could be found
here:
https://svn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/viewvc/toolkit/trunk/c++/src/misc/netstorage/test/

A binary could be taken from regular builds, e.g.:
/netopt/ncbi_tools64/c++.current/GCC-Release/bin/test_netstorage.gz


2. Setup and running

Do an svn export:
svn export https://svn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repos/toolkit/trunk/c++/src/misc/netstorage/test/

there re two files there which are of interest:
- test_netstorage.ini
- test_netstorage_server.bash

Copy both of them to the directory where the tes_netstorage binary is sitting.
They will trick the binary to substitute the service properly to test a locally
running server.
Then run as follows:

./test_netstorage_server.bash ST_Test iebdev13:9800

where:
- ST_Test is a service name used to send to the server
- iebdev13:9800 is a locally running server





Tip: how to time a query in MS SQL Server Management Studio

DECLARE @StartTime datetime,@EndTime datetime   
SELECT @StartTime=GETDATE() 

-- Your query comes here, e.g. call the GetStatInfo stored procedure
EXEC GetStatInfo

SELECT @EndTime=GETDATE()   
SELECT DATEDIFF(ms,@StartTime,@EndTime) AS [Duration in milliseconds]
