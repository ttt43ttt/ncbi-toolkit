--     - change the DB name
--     - change the guard condition

-- Changes in the DB structure:
-- - None

-- Changes in stored procedures:
-- - New procedure: GetUsers
-- - New procedure: GetUserObjects





-- NB: Change the DB name when applying
USE [NETSTORAGE_DEV];
GO
-- Recommended settings during procedure creation:
SET ANSI_NULLS ON;
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
SET ANSI_PADDING ON;
SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON;
