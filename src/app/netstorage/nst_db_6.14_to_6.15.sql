-- File Description: NetStorage server DB SP to update from version 6.14 to
--                   6.15
--


-- NB: before applying on a server you need to do two changes:
--     - change the DB name
--     - change the guard condition

-- Changes in the DB structure:
-- - None

-- Changes in stored procedures:
-- - UpdateObjectOnRelocate:
--   bug fix: Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'read_count'





-- NB: Change the DB name when applying
USE [NETSTORAGE_DEV];
GO
-- Recommended settings during procedure creation:
SET ANSI_NULLS ON;
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
SET ANSI_PADDING ON;
SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON;
GO


-- NB: change it manually when applying
